    Hi there, this is my practice website. 
    I will be upgrading it as I go along the Odin Project curriculum.
    <!-- this is a comment- you can change this heading into a nice informative popping out bracket!-->

</div class="list">
Now, what's the website about? I have no clue but here's what I'm thinking:
<ol>
    <li> 
        <a href="books.html">Books</a>
    </li>
    Reason: Books are neat.
    <li>
        <a href="climbing.html">Climbing</a>

        </li>
    Climbing is also neat, plus I want to research more and this seems like a great opportunity to do so.
</ol>
